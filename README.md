Hi. I'm Andrew. You can refer to me as the slug. I like to sharpen my knives...

I used to be a software engineer by day. I worked in various languages. I had a lot of fun developing toys using Actionscript 3. I did way too much hackery in javascript before jQuery, ventured into the dark arts of EJBs with Oracle, eventually saw the light, and the Spring cleansed me. I have journeyed through makefiles, bat files, ant files, maven poms, Gradle files, and back home to maven poms.

Now I program things for fun by night. I write fewer toys and focus more on functional tools; attempt something new with every project. Anyone can ask me anytime for the story that led me to an opinion. Some might say I have many stories.
In the future, I will still code for fun and might submit a pull request to an open-source project.
