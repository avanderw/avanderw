Hi. I'm Andrew. You can refer to me as slug. I like to talk...

I used to be a software engineer by day. I worked in various languages. I had a lot of fun developing toys using actionscript 3. I did way too much hackery in javascript prior to jQuery and even after. I ventured into the dark arts of EJBs with Oracle. I was cleansed by the Spring. I have journeyed through makefiles, bat files, ant files, maven poms, gradle files and back home to maven poms.

Now I program things for fun by night. I write less toys and focus more on functional tools. I attempt something new with every project I undertake. Anyone can ask me anytime for the story that led me to an opinion. Like many, I have maybe too many opinions. I have yet to submit a pull request to an open source project.

In future... I will still code for fun and might submit a pull request to an open source project.
